	<h2 align="middle">Position-Based Fluid Simulator</h2>
	<h3 align="middle">Ashley Nguyen: 3031877941, Jennifer Zou: 3031880970, Z Wang: 25326943</h3>

	<h3 align="middle">We will build a position-based fluid simulator to render liquids for real-time applications. This approach models fluids as spherical particles which are subjected to forces like gravity and surface tension. Our application will
		allow the user to interact with the particles by changing the size and viscosity and by applying external forces with the mouse.

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		Simulating fluids has real-life applications in everyday situations and is highly relevant in practical computer graphics rendering situations. Examples of use cases include models of ocean currents and gases across academic research and gaming
		purposes. Technically, SPH solvers guarantee incompressibility and convergence, and their inherent instability makes real-time fluid rendering very difficult and compute-intensive. We will use particle methods, which are simple and flexible, to
		simulate fluids. In particular, we use PBD as it provides unconditionally stable time integration and robustness benefits by trading incompressibility for performance. We use NVIDIAâ€™s Position Based Fluids paper
		(http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf) as our technical reference.


		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
		<h3>Baseline Plan</h2>
			We plan to render visualizations of fluids in image and video formats to gain a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics and particle interaction vis a vis graphics. We will accomplish this by implementing an iterative density solver (following
			an NVIDIA paper) within a Positional Based Dynamics Framework which approximates the incompressibility and convergence guarantees of SPH solvers.

			We believe this project is challenging but feasible in the time given. Rendering fluids requires us to learn basic fluid dynamics and modeling equations, but the generality of this task means we have many resources available for help.

			To measure quality, we'll compare our render time and computational resources to benchmarks provided in relevant research papers. The primary goal here is to render fluid simulations in a reasonable time period (less than 5 minutes for 2014
			Macbook Pro).

			With this project, we hope to shed some light on how one's understanding of particle physics and the graphics pipeline changes as a result of extending a solid-rendering implementation to fluids. We'll seek out the differences between PBD and
			SPH-based engines, and explore the space of solutions between these two approaches. We will learn how to use WebGL API to render the simulations.

			We will create an informative and engaging website, showing the journey and approach that we took and sharing the resources and follow-up questions we found.

			<h3>Aspirational Plan</h2>
				If we complete the baseline plan, we aim to create an online simulator application that will allow users to manipulate the fluid simulation with particle size and viscosity controls in real time. The user will also be able to apply additional
				external forces with the mouse. We can add more parameters to the application beyond size and viscosity of fluid. We can also simulate caustic lighting effects in water.

				Rendering instantly or in milliseconds is an aspirational goal for our project. If we create a interactive web app, adapting the scene to user commands with low latency is vital to seamless user experience. We will need to explore techniques
				for optimizing the fluid simulations.
